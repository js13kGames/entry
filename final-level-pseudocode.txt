To Start
  (x) initialize both Character states

event sequence
  get current state
  validation of event
  calculate effects of action
  set effect to state

On LEFT/RIGHT direction key press
  (x) check current state to see if you can act (are you disabled, in the middle of an attack?)
    (x) if can't disregard
    (x) else continue
  (x) check location to move, to see if it is a valid location (off map? is TRex there?)
    (x) if can't disregard
    (x) else continue
  check if location is under attack
    if so calculate effects of attack
  (x) set new location

On key press DOWN
  (x) check current state to see if you can act (are you disabled, in the middle of an attack?)
    (x) if can't disregard
    (x) else continue
  (x) set state to blocking

on key up DOWN
  // not really necessary, but might be helpful for consistency
  check current state to see if you can act (are you disabled, in the middle of an attack?)
    if can't disregard
    else continue
  (x) set temp state to READY
  check if attacked
  set calculated state and attack effects

On click
  (x) check current state to see if you can act (are you disabled, in the middle of an attack?)
    (x) if can't disregard
    (x) else continue
  (x) calculate attack location
    (x) one spot in the same direction the character is facing (characterState)
  (x) check if opponent is in the under attack location
    (x) if so calculate effects of attack
  (x) start attacking sequence
  (x) set effects state

(x) startAttackSequence
  (x) set current state to attacking
  (x) wait XXX amount of time
  (x) start disabled sequence (resetting position of attack)

check if attacked
  see if subject next to opponent
    if not break out
  see if opponent is facing subject
    if not break out
  see if opponent is attacking
    if not break out
  see if subject is blocking
    if so break out
  calculate new health dependent on damage of opponent's attack strength
  calculate new position dependent on opponent's attack force.
    check location to move, to see if it is a valid location (off map? is TRex there?)
      if can't disregard
  start disabled sequence (recovering from attack)
  check if out of health
    if so send out of health event
  set calculated effects

(x) startDisabledSequence
  (x) set as disabled
  (x) wait xxx amount of time
  (x) set current state to ready

computer intelligence

step
  same as onkeyPress LEFT/RIGHT from above

move sequence (Always moves towards opponent)
  takes at most XXX steps toward
    if didn't move, start pre attack sequence
  waits for XXX time before restarting sequence

preattack sequence
  wait for xxx sec
  start attack sequence

attack sequence
  set wind up
  wait for xxx sec
  set attacking
  wait for xxx sec
  start retreat sequence

retreat sequence
  set as disabled
  step away from opponent
  wait xxx sec
  start move sequence

wait
  takes amount of time to wait
  if hit during wait, the follow up should be cancelled
  should go into

function wait (name, time, onComplete) {
  currentWait[name] = setTimeout(() => {
    currentWait[name] = null;
    onComplete();
  }, time)
}

function breakWait (name) {
  clearTimeout(currentWait[name]);
}
