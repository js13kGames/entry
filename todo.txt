TODO:
* add coil monetization for skins :D


FEEDBACK:
- improve player responsiveness ("player unresponsive", "it doesnt move very smoothly")
- game too hard (dad, finn) [maybe increase timer?][increase the timer later]
- skimmed rules, too boring ( how to make intro more engaging?) ("how do I stab?")
- many bad words said by players
- past me not doing what I did (bug)
- typing noise hurts ears (lower gain?)

CHANGES BASED ON FEEDBACK:
+ lower gain on typing noise
+ reword opening - haven't done yet
+ make earlier levels more easy - stream lined them
+ Revamped input via an array based movement system.
