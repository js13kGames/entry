**I already made a repository, and I don't want to lose my history**

It's ok, we just need to change the git remote.

- fork [github.com/Platane/js13-entry](https://github.com/Platane/js13-entry)

- get the remote url (you can found it under the "clone or download" button, and it looks like `git@github.com:<github_login>/js13-entry.git` )

- open a term in your repository

```

# add a new remote, named "entry"
# replace git@github.com:<github_login>/js13-entry.git by your remote url
git remote add entry git@github.com:<github_login>/js13-entry.git

# get the latest commit from entry
git fetch entry

# rebase your commit history on top of the ones from entry
# which should be easy since entry have only one dummy commit
git rebase entry/master

# push to entry
git push --set-upstream entry master

```

- whenever you want to push commits to the fork, do `git push entry`

- alternatively, if you are ok with dropping your original repository, you can replace origin url instead of creating a new remote

```
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<github_login>/js13-entry.git

git fetch

git rebase origin/master

git push
```
