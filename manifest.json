	"description": "Firefox users, the game performs way better in Chrome, so if possible use it. Otherwise you may experience low FPS.\n\nBackstory:\nIt's the year 2520, humanity has expanded across the galaxy, colonizing many planetary systems with the help of an advanced AI. This AI has recently become so powerful that it has started to dominate many of the planets on the solar system, ruling mercilessly. Your objective is simple, help the humans remove all AI from the system. To do this you will need to mine resources, sell them, upgrade your ship, and help humans fight the AI in epic space battles.\n\nHow To Play:\nRead the controls, and orbital mechanics introduction before unpausing the game. \n\nYou should start the game in a pretty stable orbit, if you don't, try to stabilize it. Your first priority is choosing a planet to liberate, the starter planetstarter planet (\"New Earth\") is a good choice to start as it has very little AI population (on some worlds, it can even be 0). Once you have decided, you will need to find somewhere to mine.\nYou may want to land on a inhabited planet to buy a freighter in order to make mining faster.\nHold T and put your mouse over different planets, try to find a planet which is not too far away and which has enough ore as to fill your cargo a few times.\nGo to the planet using a transfer maneouver, land there and start mining. Once your cargo is full, take off and return to your target planet, land and sell your ore.\nYou should focus on upgrading your chosen ship for your first war.\nOnce you feel like you are ready, orbit your target planet and fire at an enemy (red) city. Enemies, and allies, will take off. Try to kill as many cities as you can, and attack\nenemies when you have a chance (your allies will keep the enemies distracted, but they are not as effective as you are). Keep in mind that killing a city will take some time, so prepare for some hovering.\nRepeat until the planet is free of AI, and then move on to another planet until there is no AI in the system! (Bottom left HUD tells you how many AI cities remain).\n\nControls:\n- W: Thrust forward \n- S: Thrust backwards \n- A: Rotate counterclockwise \n- D: Rotate clockwise \n- Q: Strafe Left\n- E: Strafe Right \n- Space: Stop rotation\n- L: Make camera align to vehicle\n- F: Return camera focus to your vehicle\n- T: Show planet surface information tooltip \n- , : Slow down time \n- . : Speed up time \n- Left Mouse Button: Fire guns \n- Right Mouse Button: Change reference frame \n- Mouse Wheel Click: Change camera focus \n- Mouse Wheel: Change zoom\n- F2: Hide HUD and appreciate the beauty of space \n\nOrbital Mechanics:\nThe game features N-body gravitation, so controlling your ship will be hard if you don't understand it. \nThe pink line that emanates from your ship is your predicted orbit, where you are going to be in the future, relative to your reference frame.\nAround your ship there is a circle with many markers on it, this is called the navcircle. It marks your velocity vector, and related vectors, relative to the reference frame:\n\n- Long Yellow Strip: Prograde, your direction of motion\n- Long Blue Strip: Normal, perpendicular to your direction of motion, points towards the planet in clockwise orbits, away in counterclockwise orbits \n- Short Yellow Strip: Retorgrade, opposite to prograde \n- Short Blue Strip: Antinormal, opposite to normal\n\nManeouvers:\n- Land: To land on a planet you should align your ship with the retrograde marker, and carefully burn, trying to keep your ship aligned retrograde, slowly approaching the surface.\n- Take-Off: You should burn until your orbit prediction is high enough. Then you will rotate so you face the normal vector, and burn until your orbit becomes more or less circular \n- Transfer: You could use advanced techniques, such as Hohmann transfers, to go places, but as the universe is quite small, and fuel is infiite, the easiest way to go to other planets is a (more or less) straight line. To do this, simply set the target body as reference frame and burn towards it, adjusting your rotation so your predicted orbit gets closer and closer. Then increase timewarp and wait until you are close, once near enough, burn retrograde to slow down and become captured by the gravity well.\n- Hover: You may want to stay over the surface to attack a city, simply wait until you are over your target, kill velocity and use your retro-thrusters, while facing the planet, to prevent falling down.\n\nTips & Tricks:\n- Make sure your ship is repaired before going mining, there is a chance that you will have an accident and suffer hull damage, which may leave you stranded \n- Upgrading your ship can make a fighter a really powerful warship, but it will be expensive\n- Selling ore on planets will increase human resources, which will mean more help when fighting the AI\n- You can timewarp while mining! This can save a lot of time.\n- Try not to shoot at human cities, you can damage them too!\n- If the generated system is too hard, feel free to refresh the page, a brand new system will be generated \n\nShips:\n- Fighter: Useful for moving around and engaging bigger ships, it's weak but fires really fast and is very agile\n- Freighter: Huge cargo, decent weapons, can do everything but masters nothing\n- Destroyer: Powerful gunship, heavy armour, but lacks speed and cargo\n\nPlanets:\n- Rocky Bodies: Rich on ore, they rarely have cities so they are a perfect target for mining \n- Deserts: They are usually dominated by AI, so be careful around them. \n- Terras: Humans prefer living here, so AI domination is slightly inferior \n- Asteroids: Like rocky planets, but very small. Useful for mining, or even as cover while on a intense battle.\n- Gas Giants: Giant spheres of gas. Don't land on them, it will kill you!",
