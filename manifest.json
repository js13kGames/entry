  "description": "This game is a game to test your memory. Circles will appear, and you need to click the circles in the opposite order as they appear. For each level, the number of circles will increase by one. Coil subscribers will have the option to restart the level, being able to see the order of the circles appearing once more. They also get a golden border.",
