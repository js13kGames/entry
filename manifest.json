  "description": "You were one of the select few chosen to trial a new hyperspace jump drive. You reach towards the red jump button in the front of your cockpit as directed; there is a whooshing noise as the jump drive spins up. Space and time warps around you, suddenly there is a bang and the ship drops out of hyperspace. \"This isnâ€™t the correct destination\" you think to yourself, the jump drive must be faulty. Return is a game about finding your way back home after being lost amongst the stars. ('Home' is the blue planet of course, a.k.a Earth).\nTested on Desktop, Mobile (magic window and Carboard).\nThe game is controlled with just a click input, look around to move the cursor and tap or click to press objects in the ship's cockpit.\nGood luck, hopefully you will find your way back!",
