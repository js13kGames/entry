"Hello ðŸ‘‹
I am a bot. My job is to review your submission.

I reviewed your latest release, [entry-valid-1](https://github.com/platane-org/js13-entry/releases/tag/entry-valid-1)

Your game seems to have error at launch, all I can see is a [blank screen](http://js13kgames-entry-preview.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cec73ecd46375ab7c64a85c8a4d2c172/game_preview_screenshot.png)
Can you take a look ? I have it deployed [here](http://js13kgames-entry-preview.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cec73ecd46375ab7c64a85c8a4d2c172/index.html)"
