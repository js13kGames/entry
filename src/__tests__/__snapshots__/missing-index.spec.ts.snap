"Hello ðŸ‘‹
I am a bot. My job is to review your submission.

I reviewed your latest release, [entry-missing-index-1](https://github.com/platane-org/js13-entry/releases/tag/entry-missing-index-1)

I could not found a index.html file in the zip archive.
I found:
\`\`\`
 - asset/text.txt
 - asset/script.js
 - asset/image/1659821.jpeg
 - game.html
\`\`\`

Can you make sure your game can be launched through a file named \`index.html\`?"
