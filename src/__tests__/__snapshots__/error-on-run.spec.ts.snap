"Hello ðŸ‘‹
I am a bot. My job is to review your submission.

I reviewed your latest release, [entry-error-on-run-1](https://github.com/platane-org/js13-entry/releases/tag/entry-error-on-run-1)

Your game seems to have error at launch, all I can see is a [blank screen](http://js13kgames-entry-preview.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/b3107c5e2f9240efdff74a17a6e5ef0b/game_preview_screenshot.png)
Can you take a look ? I have it deployed [here](http://js13kgames-entry-preview.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/b3107c5e2f9240efdff74a17a6e5ef0b/index.html)"
