# Regresso

My entry for the 2019 edition os JS13k game jam.

## About 

Regresso is a clicker game where you have a series of actions and tasks. Gameplay is about 5-10 minutes if you don't screw up.

## The Game

Your ship wrecked in an unkown land. Keep your crew well fed while you strugle your way through finding the resources to rebuild the caravel and get back to the sea. As the game progresses, you will find different actions are available to you. Try to reach the goal as fast as possible and with the least deaths for the best score. \n Coil users have a headstart of food, as well as a little help from god.

## Installing
