<h1>CIRCLE BACK</h1>
This game is a game to test your memory. Circles will appear, and you need to click the circles in the opposite order as they appear. For each level, the number of circles will increase by one.

[Coil](https://coil.com/) subscribers will have the option to restart the level, being able to see the order of the circles appearing once more. They also get an expensive gold frame instead of a black one.

The game was made with
[Kontra](https://straker.github.io/kontra/) and I made this game for the [js13kgames](https://js13kgames.com) 2019 game competition
