# APE NAPS
By Samuel Paré-Chouinard

This is Ape Naps, my submission for js13kgames 2019. In this game, you play
as a mother ape carrying her babies back home, on her back, to Bach music.

There are two levels for you to play. To complete each of them you must return
your three babies home three times within the time given. That way you can nap
three times before sundown. Mama ape loves her naps.

Controls list:
a: left
d: right
space: jump
w: wiggle
m (in practice mode): return to menu
click: skip intro

It was my first time working with native js sound and canvas, and with such
constraints. I experimented a bunch and learned just as much, so I'm thankful
for such an interesting opportunity and I'm glad I took the time to build this.
Hope you enjoy!

Thank you Melissa, Zied, Xavier testing and sharing your feedback, and thank you Pippin for your thoughts and advice.
