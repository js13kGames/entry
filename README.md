## Gameplay

You play as an soilder running back home. You can dodge bullets and bombs by the recoil, created when shooting your gun. You can also try to shoot bombs, but it is rather uneffective. 
Use you mouse to aim, and left click to shoot. On phone, shoot by tapping the srceen.

Being [Coil] subscriber enables hidden gamemode with techno background and automatic-canon instead of your slow gun. Makes the game more interesting. (!Contains flashy images!)

## Story

In the beginning of september, my friend told me about js13k competition. This was my excuse to learn JavaScript and first published game. 

### Theme
Theme in 2019 jam was black. My take on that is the idea about returning back to a previous, peacefull state. I wanted to express the wish about stopping reality and returning back to something better. I also wanted to shot that the actual return is unachivable.
After realizing that the first idea (video game based on Hesse's Siddhartha and Nietzche) would not be possible to finish in 14 days, I decided to make a war game.
...

### Chalanges
Since this was my first expirience with JavaScript, everything was going slow. Being limited with time really shows the power of expirience. 
### Converting ideas to game
.will add later.
### Size limit
Forget just about everything you know about making an organized project. Every byte counts, so don't create files just for the sake of clearness. 
When finished, change all the names and variables to something short. It can really make the difference. 
Try to avoid using pictures for the sprites. The time put into drawing is not worth it, since you will have to generate at least half of the game graphics using code anyway. 
Use other's work. [kontra.js](https://github.com/straker/kontra) and [miniMusic](https://github.com/xem/miniMusic/) helped me a lot.

## Improvements
Game still lack a lot of features. Bombs should start fires. Since this is war, background should be destroyed. More sounds. Interactive design for every resolution. Rain and snow. Actuall day and night cycle.
